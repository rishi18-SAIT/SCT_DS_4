# SCT_DS_4
TASK-4 Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualizing  accident hotspots and contributing factors

# 🚦 Traffic Accident Data Analysis (Task 04) – SkillCraft Technology Internship

## 📌 Objective

This project aims to analyze traffic accident data to uncover patterns and insights related to:
- **Road conditions**
- **Weather**
- **Time of day**

Additionally, the goal is to **visualize accident hotspots** and identify the **key contributing factors** behind traffic incidents.

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this task contains detailed information on various traffic accidents. It includes:
- Date and time of the accident
- Weather conditions
- Road surface type
- Accident severity
- Geographic coordinates
- Other contributing factors

📁 [Accident Dataset](#)  
*(Provide the actual dataset link here if publicly available or upload it to the repository)*

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Visualization
- **Plotly / Folium** – Interactive mapping (for hotspot visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab** – Execution environment

---

## 🔍 Analysis Tasks

- [x] Clean and preprocess accident data  
- [x] Explore distribution of accidents based on:
  - Time of day
  - Road surface conditions
  - Weather conditions
- [x] Identify peak accident hours and conditions
- [x] Plot and highlight accident hotspots on a map
- [x] Analyze contributing factors (e.g., lighting, road type, speed limits)

---

## 📈 Key Insights (Example)

- Most accidents occur during **evening rush hours (5 PM - 8 PM)**.
- **Wet or icy roads** significantly increase accident risk.
- **Foggy and rainy weather** are major contributors to visibility-related crashes.
- Hotspots tend to cluster around **urban intersections** and **highways**.
